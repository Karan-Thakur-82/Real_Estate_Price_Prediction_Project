# Real Estate Price Prediction Project

### Overview
The **Real Estate Price Prediction Project** is a machine learning model designed to predict apartment prices in Bangalore based on a variety of key features. This project focuses on developing a robust model that can assist potential buyers, sellers, or real estate professionals in making informed decisions. The model is built using a dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com) (Bangalore House Price dataset) and is integrated into an interactive web application where users can input specific property details to receive real-time price predictions.

### Problem Statement
The real estate market is highly dynamic, and prices can vary significantly depending on location, property size, and other factors. This project aims to provide an accurate price prediction based on available data, helping users estimate the cost of apartments in different areas of Bangalore. 

### Objectives
- Clean and preprocess raw data to remove inconsistencies and prepare it for model training.
- Engineer relevant features that significantly impact apartment prices.
- Develop and train a machine learning regression model to predict apartment prices with high accuracy.
- Create an intuitive web interface that allows users to input property details and receive price predictions.

### Dataset
The dataset used in this project was obtained from [Kaggle's Bangalore House Price dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/amitabhajoy/bengaluru-house-price-data), which contains information about various apartments in Bangalore, including:
- Location
- BHK (number of bedrooms)
- Number of bathrooms
- Area in square feet
- Price
- Availability status

### Project Workflow

1. **Data Collection**:
   - Collected the dataset from Kaggle, which contains thousands of records on Bangalore apartments.

2. **Data Cleaning**:
   - Removed irrelevant columns that don't contribute to price prediction.
   - Corrected data formats (e.g., numerical conversions, removing special characters).
   - Addressed anomalies such as extreme outliers in price and size.
   - Handled missing values using appropriate imputation techniques.

3. **Feature Engineering**:
   - Created new features and transformations to improve model accuracy.
   - Simplified location data by consolidating similar areas and removing rare occurrences.
   - Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) to better understand relationships between features and the target variable (price).

4. **Model Building**:
   - Applied multiple machine learning models including:
     - **Linear Regression**
     - **Decision Trees**
     - **Random Forest**
   - Performed hyperparameter tuning to optimize the models for better accuracy.
   - Evaluated models using cross-validation and performance metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and R² score.

5. **Model Selection**:
   - After comparing multiple models, the best-performing model was selected based on prediction accuracy and generalizability.
   - The final model uses **Random Forest Regression** due to its superior performance in handling non-linear relationships and feature interactions.

6. **Deployment**:
   - Deployed the model via a web interface using **Flask** as the backend.
   - The front-end was built with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript** to create an interactive user experience where users can input:
     - Location
     - BHK size
     - Number of bathrooms
     - Area (in sqft)
   - Upon submission, the model predicts the price and displays it instantly on the page.

### Project Features
- **User-Friendly Interface**: 
  The web application provides a simple and intuitive form for users to input apartment details and receive an immediate prediction.
  
- **Real-Time Price Prediction**:
  The model computes apartment prices based on the given inputs within seconds, offering an estimate based on trained data.

- **Flexible Input Fields**:
  Users can input any valid Bangalore location, BHK size, number of bathrooms, and apartment area to receive customized predictions.

### Technology Stack:
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**:
  - **Pandas** for data cleaning and manipulation.
  - **NumPy** for numerical computations.
  - **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn** for data visualization.
  - **Scikit-Learn** for machine learning model development.
  - **Flask** for building the web application.
- **Web Technologies**:
  - **HTML/CSS/JavaScript** for front-end development.
  - **Bootstrap** for responsive design.
- **Deployment**: 
  Deployed locally or on cloud services like **Heroku**.

### Key Challenges
- Handling outliers and anomalies in real estate data.
- Feature engineering to extract meaningful insights from raw data.
- Selecting the right model that balances both bias and variance, providing an accurate and generalizable price prediction.

### Future Improvements:
- Adding more features like nearby amenities (schools, parks, public transportation) to improve the model’s predictive power.
- Expanding the dataset to include other cities.
- Implementing advanced models like **XGBoost** or **Neural Networks** for even better accuracy.
- Enhancing the UI/UX for a more seamless user experience.

### Conclusion
This project demonstrates the power of machine learning in making data-driven decisions in the real estate sector. By leveraging a robust dataset, we built an interactive tool that can help users estimate apartment prices in Bangalore with high precision.
